Along with the listed 5 files, 2 other files were also used which couldn't be uploaded due to size limit of github.

The other two files are:
- heartrate_seconds_merged
- minuteMETsNarrow_merged

Among the listed files, HourlyActivity was created by merging all the Hourly files which were originally available and, the following process was adapted while doing so.

Open a blank worksheet in Excel and used the import option, from text/csv
Imported 3 files one by one:
> Hourly Intensities
> Hourly Calories
> Steps

Then click on : 'Query' tab > Merge > Select appropriate columns to join upon > Right click on the newly generated column and keep the column you need from the drop down

Saved this as "Hourly_Activity"
