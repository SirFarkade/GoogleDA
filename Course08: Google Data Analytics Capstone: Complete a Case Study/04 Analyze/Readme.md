**Bellabeat** is a wellness technology company that manufactures products for women's health. The company's mission is to help women improve their overall health and well-being. One of the products, the Bellabeat app, collects data from various sources like fitness activity, sleep, nutrition, stress, menstrual cycle, etc. to provide personalized insights, guidance, and feedback to women.

The case study involves *analyzing the data collected by the Bellabeat app* to gain insights into women's health behaviors and patterns. The dataset consists of four types of data:

- daily activity tracking,

- heart rate monitoring,

- sleep monitoring, and

- weight monitoring.

The data is spread across multiple tables and needs to be combined and analyzed to gain meaningful insights.

The first step in the analysis is to:

- calculate the number of users who are actively using the Bellabeat app to track their physical activities, heart rate, sleep, and weight,

- query the respective tables, and

- count the number of unique user IDs.

The average, minimum, and maximum values for various metrics like steps, distance, calories, heart rate, weight, hours asleep, and hours in bed are also calculated.

Next, the data is analyzed to identify patterns and trends. For example, the daily activity data is analyzed to find:

- the most active times of the day,

- the most popular activities, and

- the correlation between various metrics like steps, distance, and calories burned.

The heart rate data is analyzed to identify trends in:

- resting heart rate,
- maximum heart rate, and
- heart rate variability.

The sleep data is analyzed to identify patterns in:

- sleep duration,
- sleep stages, and
- sleep efficiency.

The weight data is analyzed to identify trends in:

- weight gain or loss and
- the correlation between weight and other metrics like steps and calories burned.

Finally, the insights gained from the analysis are used to provide personalized guidance and feedback to women. For example, the app can:

- recommend specific activities or exercises based on the user's activity level,
- suggest changes to the user's diet based on the number of calories burned,
- recommend changes to the user's sleep routine based on the quality and duration of sleep, and
- provide feedback on weight loss or gain based on the user's weight data.

In summary, the case study involves analyzing data from various sources to gain insights into women's health behaviors and patterns and provide personalized guidance and feedback to women. The analysis involves combining and querying data from multiple tables, calculating various metrics, identifying patterns and trends, and using the insights gained to provide personalized guidance and feedback.
