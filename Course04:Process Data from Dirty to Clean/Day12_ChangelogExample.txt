Best practices for changelogs

A changelog for a personal project may take any form desired. However, in a professional setting and while collaborating with others, readability is important. These guiding principles help to make a changelog accessible to others: 

Changelogs are for humans, not machines, so write legibly.

Every version should have its own entry.

Each change should have its own line.

Group the same types of changes. For example, Fixed should be grouped separately from Added.

Versions should be ordered chronologically starting with the latest.

The release date of each version should be noted.

All the changes for each category should be grouped together. Types of changes usually fall into one of the following categories:

Added: new features introduced

Changed: changes in existing functionality

Deprecated: features about to be removed

Removed: features that have been removed

Fixed: bug fixes

Security: lowering vulnerabilities
